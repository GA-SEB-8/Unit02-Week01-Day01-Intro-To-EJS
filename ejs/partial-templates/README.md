**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to implement partial templates in EJS to create reusable components.

## Why use partial templates?

Imagine an app with several different pages, each needing a navigation bar at the top. You *might* initially copy and paste the same HTML for the nav bar across all these pages. But what happens when you need to update the nav bar? Updating it manually on every page is time-consuming and error-prone.

Fortunately, EJS includes the ability to make our views more DRY by using *partial templates*. Partial templates are essentially reuseable bits of template code that can be included in any EJS file. With a partial template, you can define your nav bar just once, and then include it in each view. Even better, if we need to make a change to the `nav`, we only need to touch one file.

## Inserting partial templates

The `<%- %>` EJS tags allow us to output HTML, meaning we can directly inject HTML code from other files into our views.

To include a partial template, use the following syntax:

```html
<%- include('filename') %>
```

## Creating partial templates

To demonstrate, let's create some partial templates.

```bash
mkdir views/partials
touch views/partials/html-head.ejs
touch views/partials/nav.ejs
```

### Creating a partial for HTML head

Since our HTML boilerplate is consistent across views, we'll create a partial for it:

In `partials/html-head.ejs`, add:

```html
<!-- partials/html-head.ejs -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Inventory App</title>
</head>
<body>
```

> ðŸ§   Note that we don't close the `<html>` or `<body>` tags - that's ok, these are called partial for a reason! It will be closed in the file where this partial is imported. This concept is important - it lets your partials be very flexible.
>
> For example, if we wanted to customize what's in the html's `<head>` on each page (so we could do things like use page-specific stylesheets) you may prefer to move the closing `</head>` tag out of this file.

### Creating a nav bar partial

Next, in `partials/nav.ejs`, add the following:

```html
<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/link-two">Example Link 2</a>
  <a href="/link-three">Example Link 3</a>
</nav>
```

Note that the example links won't work currently

### Refactoring `home.ejs` with partials

With these partials created, we can refactor `home.ejs`.

Replace existing boilerplate in `home.ejs` with partial templates:

```html
<%- include('./partials/html-head') %>
<%- include('./partials/nav') %>
  <h1>We are rendering a page!</h1>
  <p><%= msg %></p>
  <ul>
    <% inventory.forEach((item, index)=>{ %>
      <a href="/<%= index %>">
        <li>
          <%= item.name %>: <%= item.qty %>
        </li>
      </a>
    <% }) %>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

### Using partials in `show.ejs`

Finally, let's reuse the same partials to include our nav bar in `show.ejs`:

```html
<%- include('./partials/html-head') %>
<%- include('./partials/nav') %>
  <h1>Welcome to the <%= item.name %> page!</h1>
  <p>There are <%= item.qty %> left.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Updating the nav bar

Now we have a nav bar that is reusable across all of our views! If we want to make a change to the nav bar on every view, we only need to edit `nav.ejs` once.

To add a new link, simply update `nav.ejs`.

For example:

```html
<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/0">Candle Page</a>
  <a href="/1">Cheese Page</a>
</nav>
```

If we check the browser, we can see that this is updated everywhere. Now, when the user navigates to a `show` route, they can use the `home` link rather than hitting the back button in their browser.

If you were to continue building out this website, adding multiple new views that need navigation, you can imagine the benefit of consolidating all of this code into one easily reuseable code snippet. That's the power of partials!
